* kind-metallb-colima-full.sh is inspired by [this 2023 blog](https://www.opencredo.com/blogs/building-the-best-kubernetes-test-cluster-on-macos). It sets up a `kind`-based developent environment on Mac with Apple Silicone, Colima, and MetalLB. The script automates the steps in the blog while adapting for 2025 and adding some additinal configurations and definitions.
